## Contract (v1)

| Function | Description |

| `getListing(id)` | Read owner, skills, active flag |
| `cancelListing(id)` | Deactivate listing (owner only) |

Design details: [docs/design.md](docs/design.md)

## Test in Remix

1. Open [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and add `SkillSwap.sol`.
2. Compile with **Solidity 0.8.20+**.
3. Deploy on **Remix VM (London)**.
4. Call `createListing("Solidity", "React")` → check `listingCount`.
5. Call `getListing(0)` → verify returned fields.
6. Call `cancelListing(0)` → `getListing(0)` should show `active: false`.

Full checklist: [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md)
